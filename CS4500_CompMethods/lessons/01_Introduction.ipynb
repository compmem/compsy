    "\n",
    "- You should keep your video on unless a transient issue arises (e.g., there is something seriously distracting going on in the room.) \n",
    "- You can, however, keep your microphone muted when not talking.\n",
    "- Feel free to ask questions anytime! It's often hard for me to see everyone, so interjecting by voice is perfectly fine (i.e., you don't need to use the hand-raising feature in the Zoom chat.)\n",

    "## Why use a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A *virtual environment* creates a folder that contains all of the libraries and code necessary to use the packages needed by a specific project. \n",
    "- Virtual environments allow the user to have different versions of the same package on the same system. \n",
    "- This is important because some packages are only compatible with early versions of other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Assume you have two packages you want to install on your machine, Package A and Package B\n",
    "    - Package A and Package B are both dependent on the same package, Package C\n",
    "    - Package A only works with version 1.1.19 or earlier of Package C\n",
    "    - Package B only works with version 1.2.1 or later of Package C\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If a user were to attempt to install both versions of Package C in the same environment (so they could use Package A and Package B) and a script calls a function from Package C, then the package manager would have conflicting versions of Package C that could lead to unexpected behavior invalidating the results of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - With the virtual environment approach, the user can make a separate virtual environment to accommodate the two conflicting but necessary versions of Package C. \n",
    "    - In one environment, the user can install Package A and version 1.1.19 of Package C.\n",
    "    - In the other environment, the user can install Package B and version 1.2.1 of Package C.\n",
    "    - No conflicts!\n",
