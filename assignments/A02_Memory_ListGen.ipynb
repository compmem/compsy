    "\n",
    "The main question of this study is whether recognition memory for\n",
    "words depends on the emotional or affective valence of those words and whether there is an interaction between attention refreshing and valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants will study lists of positive (+), negative (-), and\n",
    "neutral (~) words and then, after a short delay, they will be given a\n",
    "recognition test over all the studied target words plus a matched set\n",
    "of non-studied lures.  The stimuli are contained in three separate CSV\n",
    "files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Positive Pool](./pos_pool.csv)\n",
    "- [Negative Pool](./neg_pool.csv)\n",
    "- [Neutral Pool](./neu_pool.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to read these files in as lists of dictionaries (hint,\n",
    "use the ``DictReader`` from the ``csv`` module that was covered in\n",
    "class.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use these pools to create lists with trials of valence crossed with three experimental conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Repeated*: Where a word will be immediately repeated as the next word.\n",
    "2. *Refreshed*: Where you will indicate the participant should \"refresh\" the previous word by presenting a \"+\".\n",
    "3. *Once-presented*: Where a word is only presented once and is *not* repeated or refreshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest that you generate the study items for a list in two stages. In the first stage you shuffle all combinations of the trial types (Valence crossed with Condition). In the second stage you loop over those conditions and append trials to a block depending on the information in each trial type. For the Repeated and Refreshed you would append two items, for the Once-presented you would only append one.\n",

    "Be sure to add in information to each trial dictionary that identifies\n",

    "While the massed items come immediately after the first time the item was presented, the spaced repetitions need to come at a range of 3 to 7 (though this should be a configuration variable) items following the first presentation of the matching item. We will provide some suggestions for how to attain this structure in class discussions, but generally following a two-stage approach of shuffling all possible conditions first and then filling in specific items will work best. *Note, you can not have a spaced item condition in the last two slots on the list because it would not be possible to have the repetition be spaced.*\n",
