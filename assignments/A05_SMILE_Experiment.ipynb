    "Your assignment is to turn the lists generated by code from the previous assignment into an experiment. As a reminder, regardless of whether you selected option 1 or option 2, this is a recognition memory experiment. This means that participants will study a list of items one at a time, and then, after a short delay, be tested for their memory of those items. In the test phase of each block, participants will see the study items again, along with an equal number of new items, and for each item they must specify whether the item is an old target item (i.e., one that was on the study list) or a new lure item. \n",

    "The high level structure of the experiment is as follows:\n",

    "- Present the participant some instructions explaining the task\n",
    "- Optionally provide some practice making responses\n",
    "- Loop over the blocks of study--test lists\n",

    "\n",
    "- Wait for the participant to press a key to start the block\n",
    "- Loop over the study list presenting the study items, one at a time\n",
    "- Wait for a delay (we may eventually fill this with some simple math problems)\n",
    "- Loop over the test list to present the test items, one at a time, waiting for a keyboard response on each item\n",
    "\n",
    "Each study item trial will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Present the item for a specified duration (this should be a configuration variable at the top of your code)\n",
    "- Wait an inter-stimulus duration plus some amount of jitter (these, too, should be config variables)\n",
    "- Log the stimulus information, including when it appeared on the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test item trial will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Present the item on the screen (with either a Label or Image state) until the participant makes a keyboard response of either the key you have selected to indicate the item is \"old\" or the key that indicates the item is \"new\"\n",
