    "You can copy the basic template code for loading and processing the data from the class lessons. We also outline what each section of your assignment should include. In addition to describing the experiment in detail, you will be developing novel hypotheses we did not test in class and then performing the associated analyses and visualizing the results. As always, make sure to label all figures and be sure to refer to the code in the lesson notebooks as a guide for your analyses.\n",

For this option you must get approval from me, but the goal is to have the chance to apply some of the methods from this class in support of your own work. For example, you could design an new experiment and implement it in SMILE, or you could perform a novel analysis of your own data and visualize the results. There are tons of possibilities and I am eager to discuss options with you.\n",
