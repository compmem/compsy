    "\n",
    "- Download the flanker.zip file\n",
    "- Unzip it (usually with a command like, `unzip flanker.zip`\n",
    "- Change to the `flanker` directory, `cd flanker`\n",
    "- Activate the smile virtual environment: `conda activate smile`\n",
    "- Then run the experiment with: `python flanker_exp.py -s mst3k`, replacing `mst3k` with your userid.\n",
    "- Follow the instructions and try to perform well on all the blocks (it should take around 5 minutes.)\n",

It will have a name with the following format `flanker_subj_session.zip`, where subj will be the userid you entered above, and session will be the date/time when you started the experiment. You will upload these data to one of the matching assignment.\n",
