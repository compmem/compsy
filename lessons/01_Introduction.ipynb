    "- We have entered into an age where artificial intelligence models are able to help us with many aspects of our lives. \n",

    "  - It is also very unlikely that an AI model would be able to produce output for this class that would be fully correct without significant knowledge transfer from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We are also at a point where we should be actively exploring the boundaries of what AI can do and what it we should not be relying on it to do. Thus, my policy for this year is that, *unless specified in the assignment*, you are free to use AI models such as ChatGPT or Bard as long as you follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - State on your submitted work what AI model you used (including version, such as ChatGPT 3.5).\n",
    "  - Where applicable, include the prompts you used to generate the output.\n",
    "  - Double-check the output for accuracy because that's a major avenue for learning (and we can not fully trust the output from these models).\n",

    "## Why use a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A *virtual environment* creates a folder that contains all of the libraries and code necessary to use the packages needed by a specific project. \n",
    "- Virtual environments allow the user to have different versions of the same package on the same system. \n",
    "- This is important because some packages are only compatible with early versions of other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Assume you have two packages you want to install on your machine, Package A and Package B\n",
    "    - Package A and Package B are both dependent on the same package, Package C\n",
    "    - Package A only works with version 1.1.19 or earlier of Package C\n",
    "    - Package B only works with version 1.2.1 or later of Package C\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If a user were to attempt to install both versions of Package C in the same environment (so they could use Package A and Package B) and a script calls a function from Package C, then the package manager would have conflicting versions of Package C that could lead to unexpected behavior invalidating the results of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - With the virtual environment approach, the user can make a separate virtual environment to accommodate the two conflicting but necessary versions of Package C. \n",
    "    - In one environment, the user can install Package A and version 1.1.19 of Package C.\n",
    "    - In the other environment, the user can install Package B and version 1.2.1 of Package C.\n",
    "    - No conflicts!\n",

    "    - This command creates a new virtual environment separate from the base environment and installs all the packages\n",
